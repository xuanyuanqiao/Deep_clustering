# Deep_clustering
### Algorithm description 
This method is based on DESC, which is an unsupervised deep learning algorithm for clustering scRNA-seq data.
The algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping function from the original scRNA-seq data space to a low-dimensional feature space by iteratively learning cluster-specific gene expression representation and cluster assignment based on a deep neural network.
